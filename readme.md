# About Application


Measuring greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is key for organizations aiming for net-zero goals. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) helps estimate these emissions across a productâ€™s lifeâ€”from raw materials to disposal. A major challenge in this process is matching each product or activity with the right emission factor (EF), which is often manual, slow, and complex.

Our app automates this step using AI. It takes a product or service description, searches the ecoinvent EF database, and recommends the top two matching EFs with easy-to-understand explanations. This saves time, reduces errors, and helps companies report their carbon footprint more accurately.

ie, This application automates **Process-Based Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)** by mapping free-form item descriptions to relevant environmental **impact factors** using semantic search and LLMs.

##  What It Does

Given a product or item description, the app performs the following:

1. **Embeds the input** using the `thenlper/gte-large` model.
2. **Matches** the description to the most semantically similar reference products from the **Ecoinvent** dataset using **cosine similarity**.
3. **Selects** the top 2 relevant **impact factors** based on embeddings and LLM-based reasoning.
4. **Returns**:
   - `reference_product`: Closest match from Ecoinvent
   - `score`: Embedding similarity score between item description and reference product
   - `justification`: Explanation for this match
   - `impact_factor_name`: Top 2 selected impact factor names
   - `impact_factor_score`: Similarity score between item description and impact factor
   - `impact_factor_justification`: LLM-generated rationale for why the impact factor is relevant

##  How It Works

| Component             | Technology Used                   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Embedding Model      | [`thenlper/gte-large`](https://huggingface.co/thenlper/gte-large) |
| LLM Model            | `gemini-2.0-flash`                |
| Vector Store         | [ChromaDB](https://www.trychroma.com/) |
| Similarity Metric    | Cosine Similarity                 |
| Dataset              | Ecoinvent                         |

The system stores embeddings for Ecoinvent entries in ChromaDB and leverages an LLM to provide contextual explanations and select the most relevant impact factors.
